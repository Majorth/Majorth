- Hi, I’m Todd Hostetler @Majorth
- I’m interested in becoming a full stack web developer.
- I’m currently learning full stack web development--HTML5, CSS, JS, Python, React--on freeCodeCamp primarily and secondarily on Odin Project. 
- I'm posting my projects to show my evolution as I learn. Plus, it's a way to look back at key learning objectives for reference as I'm making notes about certain codes. 
- I’m looking to collaborate with others and become more involved in the community as I learn. I recently joined the DEV Community on Forem and am enjoying the the site. 
- How to reach me: majorth@icloud.com
